A little game to celebrate Xmas.

Play it here: http://dalliance.net/xmas2011/

You are Santa, and your bar has been invaded by a bunch
of pirates. Can you keep 'em drunk and happy until the
song ends?

It's all GPL and Creative Commons sharealike, depending where
the source stuff came from. Look in the "credits.txt" file
to see the stuff I took from elsewhere. The rest is all me,

The f4v audio clips aren't included, make some and call
them "level1.flv", "level2.flv" etc.
