A little game to celebrate Xmas.

Play it here: http://handsomejacks.co.uk/index.php/xmas-game

You are Santa, and you've invited a whole bunch of Pirates
around to preview your latest movie. If they like it, it
could go viral as they pirate it all around the network.

But to make them like it, you'll need to keep them good
and drunk.

Made for Handsome Jack's Showband ( http://handsomejacks.co.uk/ )
and the Commons Hostage ( http://commonshostage.com / )

It's all GPL and Creative Commons sharealike, depending where
the source stuff came from. Look in the "credits.txt" file
to see the stuff I took from elsewhere. The rest is all me,

The video clip we built it for isn't included coz frankly
it's far too big. Put your own .flv as videoClip.flv and
it'll play that.
